A minute-granularity weather data-set from a local station of San Diego, collected for a period of three years is used for analysis. We are doing cluster analysis to generate a big picture model of the weather.
Used StandardScaler to standardize the features and then used KMeans clustering to create 12 clusters for the weather data we have.
