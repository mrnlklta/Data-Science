Used the titanic dataset from kaggle and did data exploration, finding outlier values with box plots
and replacing them, impute missing values, plot graphs with matplotlib, predict survivability using
decision tree.  Also various statistical operations like pivot_table, crosstab, groupby are applied along
with pandas function like fillna, lambda function etc.
